# RoastMyWeb: Because Your Website Needs a Reality Check

Welcome to RoastMyWeb, the app that's here to lovingly tear your website apart and put it back together... maybe. We're like that brutally honest friend you never knew you needed, but for your web presence.

## What's This Madness?

RoastMyWeb is a Next.js application that analyzes websites and provides a sarcastic, ironic, and somewhat humorous roast of things you could improve regarding SEO and Google's Core Web Vitals. Because let's face it, your website probably needs it.

## Prerequisites

Before you embark on this journey of self-discovery (and potential self-loathing), make sure you have:

- Node.js (preferably a version that doesn't make your computer cry)
- A sense of humor (critical for reading the roasts)
- Thick skin (also critical for reading the roasts)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository (if you dare):

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/roastmyweb.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd roastmyweb
   ```

3. Install dependencies (grab a coffee, this might take a while):

   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your API keys:
   ```
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
   GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
   ```
   (Don't worry, we won't judge you for your API key choices... much.)

## Usage

1. Start the development server:

   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

3. Enter a URL, sit back, and prepare for a roasting that would make Gordon Ramsay proud.

## Features

- SEO analysis (because meta tags are still a thing, apparently)
- Core Web Vitals check (we'll tell you if your site is as slow as a sloth on sedatives)
- Sarcastic commentary (our AI has a PhD in Sass)
- Responsive design (unlike your website, probably)

## Technologies

This project uses a plethora of dependencies because why use one when you can use twenty? Here are some highlights:

- Next.js (for that sweet, sweet server-side rendering)
- React (because who doesn't love a good component hierarchy?)
- Tailwind CSS (for when you're too lazy to write your own CSS)
- Framer Motion (to add some pizzazz to your pain)
- Zod (because TypeScript wasn't strict enough)
- SWR (for fetching data and caching your shame)
- Vercel AI SDK - The AI Toolkit for TypeScript and JavaScript

## Contributing

Found a bug? Want to add more sass to our roasts? Feel free to contribute! Just remember, we roast code contributions as mercilessly as we roast websites.

Now go forth and roast some websites! Remember, a good roast is like a good website: it should be quick, impactful, and leave people wanting more... unlike most of the sites you'll be analyzing.
